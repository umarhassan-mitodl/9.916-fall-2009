Course Assignments
------------------

Assignments consist of 1.5 hours of student paper presentations, 2-3 papers that are required readings and several optional readings.

### Presentations

Presentations last 15 minutes each and contain no more than 15 slides (not counting the title slide). Ideal presentations will offer an integrated view of the issue, not a sequential enumeration of the papers' results. Each participant will give 2-4 presentations over the semester, depending on class size.

### Final Paper

The final paper will review and critique the literature on one topic from the course, connecting data from at least two different levels of analysis (e.g. molecular, systems, cognitive, social psychological, sociological, anthropological). 8-12 pages, double spaced. Papers are due Ses #10.
